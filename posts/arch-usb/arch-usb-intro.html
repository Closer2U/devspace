<h1 id="before">Before You Begin</h1>

<p>Although a typical Arch Linux installation with a fully functional desktop
environment usually ranges from about 3GB to 5GB, I recommend using at least a
16GB stick. Being that this is an entirely portable Linux system of your own,
you may want to load it up with a collection of some great GNU and open source
software packages out there.  With some large packages like <a
href="../../external.html?link=http://www.sagemath.org/" target="_blank">SageMath</a>, <a
href="../../external.html?link=https://www.tug.org/texlive/" target="_blank">TeX Live</a>, and various
developer tools, my current Arch Linux USB drive sits at around 12GB.</p>

<h2 id="live_img">live image</h2>

<p>You will also need to <a href="../../external.html?link=https://www.archlinux.org/download/"
target="_blank">download</a> an Arch Linux bootable installation ISO and either
burn it to a CD or write it to a different USB stick than the one you will be
installing your persistent copy on.  I have used both methods with no problems,
but the speed of installation is much greater when using a bootable USB
stick.</p>

<p>To write a bootable USB installation medium in Linux, run the following
command where <em>/path/archlinux.iso</em> is the path of the downloaded ISO and
<em>/dev/sdX</em> is the path of your unmounted target USB drive:</p>

<div class="code"><span class="prompt"># </span>
dd if=<em>/path/archlinux.iso</em> of=<em>/dev/sdX</em> status=progress &amp;&amp; sync
</div>

<p>To make a bootable USB using Windows, I have used the open source GUI tool <a
href="../../external.html?link=https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank">Rufus</a> on several occasions
without any issues.  If Rufus doesn't work for you, there are multiple other <a
href="../../external.html?link=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-tools-make-bootable-usb-iso-file/"
target="_blank">programs</a> intended for the same thing.</p>

<p>Users with a current working installation of Arch Linux can opt to forgo a
new boot medium altogether and simply partition, format, <i>pacstrap</i>, and
<i>arch-chroot</i> into the target USB drive instead.  The instructions to do so
are not explicitly provided here as that is not the scope of this guide, but the
important parts of the process are identical.</p>

<h2 id="wired_wifi">wired vs wifi</h2>

<p>For the actual installation you will need a computer connected to the
internet.  A wired connection is definitely preferred as the bootable
installation ISO is setup to automatically detect and connect to any wired
network on bootup.  Also, any packages you choose to install will need to be
downloaded from the Arch Linux repositories, and network speed may be a limiting
factor over wifi.</p>

<p>The instructions in this guide will setup your persistent bootable USB to
automatically configure a wired network connection whenever a network cable is
detected.  Support for most wifi interfaces will also be installed, but
automatic connection will not be enabled.  Having automatic wifi connection
capability is quite simple to setup, but for this bootable Linux USB it won't be
enabled by default as not every machine it is boot on will even have a wifi
interface.</p>

<p>Lastly, Linux kind of has a horrible history of working with some wifi
interfaces.  There is a chance, albeit rare, that you may be the proud owner of
a wifi networking device not compatible with Linux... yet (until you write the
driver for it!).  For more information pertaining to Linux wireless interface
compatibility, see the official <a href="../../external.html?link=https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/"
target="_blank">wireless wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bios_uefi">BIOS vs UEFI</h2>

<p>Basically, there are two different systems implemented today that
motherboards use to communicate between an operating system and their firmware.
There is the standard (legacy) <a href="../../external.html?link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS"
target="_blank">BIOS</a> (basic input/output system), and there is the newer <a
href="../../external.html?link=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface"
target="_blank">UEFI</a> (unified extensible firmware interface).  Although UEFI
was implemented on some top-end machines in the early 2000s, any computer more
than ten to fifteen years old is probably only going to be able to boot up in BIOS
mode.  Newer machines, on the other hand, will often be capable of booting in
both UEFI mode and BIOS mode.  Many times a preferred boot mode can be selected
from the BIOS menu on such machines.  Current Apple computers only recognize
UEFI.</p>

<p>Both BIOS and UEFI require different particular partition schemes in order to
boot.  If the motherboard is set to boot in UEFI mode only and the inserted boot
media does not have the correct partition scheme for UEFI, the boot will fail;
the same goes for an attempted BIOS boot.  This is one place I believe some of
the USB installation guides out there fail: they often only describe how to
create a USB boot device that uses only one mode.  It is possible, however, to
setup a USB drive that will have a partition scheme allowing it to boot in both
modes and still use the same persistent installation of Linux.  This guide will
setup such a scheme in the partitioning and formatting sections below.</p>

<p>On most newer machines, you will be presented with the option to boot in
either BIOS or UEFI mode from your bootable USB.  This means the machine
recognizes the UEFI boot media, but it does not always mean the machine is
actually set to boot in UEFI mode, and selecting the UEFI boot option may fail.
Selecting a mode that the motherboard is not set to boot in will not damage
anything or touch any of the other drives on the machine, the boot will simply
fail and one can reboot in the other mode.  The USB stick created with this
guide has been able to boot on every (about a dozen) desktop and laptop, new and
old, BIOS and UEFI, machine that I have tried it on.</p>

<h2 id="secure_boot">secure boot</h2>

<p>The new UEFI specification also includes an optional mechanism to protect
against pre-boot malware.  The <a
href="../../external.html?link=http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/secureboot.html"
target="_blank">secure boot</a> protocol is designed to only allow the booting
of images signed with a <a
href="../../external.html?link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)"
target="_blank">cryptographic key</a> contained in a machine's <a
href="../../external.html?link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_random-access_memory"
target="_blank">NVRAM</a>.  If secure boot is enabled and a boot image lacks a
cryptographic signature or the signature doesn't correspond to a key listed in
the computer's NVRAM, the firmware will refuse to execute the boot image.  The
most common workaround when dealing with secure boot on Linux machines is to
simply disable the secure boot option in the machine's BIOS menu.</p>

<p>If it is not possible to disable secure boot in a machine's BIOS or you wish
to use secure boot on your Arch Linux USB, you will need to install a <a
href="../../external.html?link=https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shim-signed/" target="_blank">signed
bootloader</a> and properly <a
href="../../external.html?link=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Secure_Boot#Set_up_shim"
target="_blank">set it up</a> after this guide.</p>

<h2 id="localtime_utc">localtime vs UTC</h2>

<p>There are two time standards used by the internal hardware clock of a modern
computer to store the current time.  Localtime is dependent on the machine's
current geographical time zone and often takes daylight savings into account,
while <a href="../../external.html?link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"
target="_blank">UTC</a> (coordinated universal time) is the same regardless of
global location.  The hardware clock stores the current time, in one of these
two formats, by storing separate values for <i>year, month, day, hour,
minute</i>, and <i>second</i>.</p>

<p>The hardware clock does not, however, retain any record of what format its
time values are kept in or if there has been any adjustment made for daylight
savings.  It's up to the operating system to keep track of these settings.  This
can pose some issues if multiple operating systems are boot on the same computer
using localtime as its time format.  For instance, both operating systems might
adjust the hardware clock time for daylight savings resulting in an extra hour
of difference.</p>

<p>The obvious solution, here, is to simply use UTC on all operating systems and
be done with it.  MacOS uses UTC, Linux uses UTC by default, but Windows uses
localtime by default.  In other words, when booting the Linux USB off of a
machine primarily used with Windows, the chances are that the hardware clock is
going to appear to be incorrect.</p>

<p>What this means for the Linux USB is that you may occasionally see some
time-stamp warning messages when you boot up your USB off different machines.
We will enable a network time protocol so that the USB Linux system will update
its operating system clock as soon as an internet connection is established and
correct these discrepancies.  More importantly, though, the Linux system will
also update the hardware clock to the correct time in UTC, meaning the next time
Windows is boot it may encounter some time-stamp errors.  In my experience, this
hasn't been an issue beyond the infrequent warning message at bootup.</p>

<h2 id="partitioning">partitioning notes</h2>

<p>Another possibly useful option not explicitly shown in this guide is
partitioning the target USB device to function as both a persistent bootable USB
and an <a href="../../external.html?link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS" target="_blank">NTFS</a> or
<a href="../../external.html?link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table"
target="_blank">FAT32</a> formatted storage device fully compatible as a
Windows, Linux, or OSX standard USB jump drive.</p>

<p>A final thing to point out is the lack of a <a
href="../../external.html?link=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/swap" target="_blank">swap</a>
partition in this installation of Linux.  The reason for this is twofold.
First, recognizing that flash memory has a finite number of writes before it
eventually goes bad, the lack of a swap partition may at least decrease some of
those writes.  Second, realizing that nearly any computer you boot up onthese
days has at least a few gigabytes of available RAM, the need for a swap
partition is mostly non-existent.</p>

<h1 id="why">Why Arch Linux?</h1>

<p>There are already several guides to setting up a persistent Linux
installation on a USB drive out there, including a dedicated <a
href="../../external.html?link=https://wiki.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">ArchWiki</a> <a
href="../../external.html?link=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installing_Arch_Linux_on_a_USB_key"
target="_blank">page</a>.  In theory, an installation on a USB key should be no
different than any other installation, and perhaps some GUI installers out there
will work just fine.  However I've heard of several failed attempts at getting a
USB Linux installation working properly when working from said installers or
guides.  I have a few ideas on why this might be occurring and have attempted to
correct these scenarios with this process.  Arch Linux serves this purpose well
due to its ability to easily change  configuration options to the user's
need.</p>

<h2 id="about">about this guide</h2>

<p>Perhaps the biggest reason for the existence of this entire
guide is my own curiosity. You may find the nature of an Arch Linux
installation provides more insight into what is happening behind the scenes
than any GUI installation tool out there.  Messing around with Linux like this
can be fun (and frustrating!).  I find learning how my computer works and
finely tuning its configuration to be rewarding.  With an Arch Linux persistent
bootable USB I have my own completely custom operating system, application set,
and user interface with me in my pocket everywhere I go!</p>

<p>Also, I suppose I should say, I am in no way officially
associated with Linux or the Arch Linux project.  I am simply a curious
tinkerer who uses the act writing things like this as a learning experience.  I
have personally followed these steps over a dozen times on multiple computers
with no problems, but I can't guarantee it will work for you.  I wrote this
guide to be (hopefully) followable by anyone with a moderate understanding of
current PCs.  My intention is for this to be a fully self contained guide, yet
numerous links are provided throughout the text to supporting references and
additional resources.</p>
